# Machine Learning Primer

This repository is meant as a review of important machine learning concepts,
from their mathematical explanations to practical implementations.

### Who this is meant for

As an ML practitioner and software developer, I've found it difficult to always
remember the fundamentals of machine learning. I'm building this repo as a reference
guide for practitioners and also as a "quick-starter" for anyone new to machine learning,
who's curiosity goes beyond the black box implementations of popular libraries.

### Current Road Map

The plan is to start with traditional ML techniques, and then delve into the exciting
world of neural networks. Finally, reviews on Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability
Theory will be added. This is where the work currently stands:
