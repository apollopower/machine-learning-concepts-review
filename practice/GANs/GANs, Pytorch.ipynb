    "A recent (Goodfellow, 2014) innovation in Deep Learning, GANs refer to the utilization of two unique neural networks to generate data that modeled from real-life inputs.\n",

    "For example, if a machine learning engineer is working with too small of a dataset, he/she could possibly implement GANs to build more training data for more effective AI work."

    "### How do GANs work?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, GANs are models based on two neural networks. We can refer to them as a __Generator__ and a __Discriminator__. Lets break down their roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Generator:__ Works on simply creating new data that mimics some input training data.\n",
    "- __Discriminator:__ Has the job of identifying the generated fake data from the actual. It provides a probability of how likely the data it is looking at is genuine rather than fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through backpropagation, both neural nets can co-train each other, with the generator improving its own data creation and the discriminator learning to seperate the real and generated data."
